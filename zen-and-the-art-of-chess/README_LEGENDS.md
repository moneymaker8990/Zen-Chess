   - Uses their actual opening repertoire
   - 100% authentic

2. **Real Game Positions**
   - Any position from their games
   - Replays their exact move
   - 100% authentic

3. **Similar Positions**
   - Transpositions and similar positions
   - Uses moves from similar games
   - 80% authentic

4. **Style-Biased Engine**
   - Only in completely novel positions
   - Applies their playing style
   - Authentic feel

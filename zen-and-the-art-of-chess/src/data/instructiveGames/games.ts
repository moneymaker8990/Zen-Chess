    white: 'Adolf Anderssen',
    black: 'Lionel Kieseritzky',
    year: 1851,
    event: 'London (Casual Game)',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: "King's Gambit",
    eco: 'C33',
    title: 'The Immortal Game',
    themes: ['Sacrifice', 'King hunt', 'Development advantage', 'Attack'],
    era: 'romantic',
    category: 'tactical',
    difficulty: 3,
    
    whyInstructive: `The Immortal Game represents the purest expression of Romantic chess philosophy: that beauty and brilliance matter as much as material. Anderssen sacrifices both rooks, his bishop, and eventually his queen—yet delivers checkmate with just three minor pieces. This game teaches us that piece activity, king safety, and attack can outweigh material considerations. It's a reminder that chess is not merely a counting game but an art form where creativity can triumph over conventional wisdom.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Development and piece activity can be worth more than material',
      'An exposed king is a fatal weakness—attack it relentlessly',
      'Sometimes the most "unsound" moves contain the deepest truth',
      'Beauty in chess comes from harmony between pieces',
      'The initiative, once seized, must not be surrendered',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Played during the first international chess tournament in London, 1851. This casual game between the two strongest players of the day was not part of the official competition, but it became the most famous game of the 19th century. The term "Immortal Game" was coined by Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer.',

    dayNumber: 2,
    white: 'Adolf Anderssen',
    black: 'Jean Dufresne',
    year: 1852,
    event: 'Berlin (Casual Game)',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Evans Gambit',
    eco: 'C52',
    title: 'The Evergreen Game',
    themes: ['Sacrifice', 'Attack', 'Piece coordination', 'King safety'],
    era: 'romantic',
    category: 'tactical',
    difficulty: 3,
    
    whyInstructive: `Called "Evergreen" because its beauty never fades, this game showcases Anderssen's ability to combine multiple sacrifices into a harmonious attack. Unlike the Immortal Game's wild sacrifices, here Anderssen demonstrates more calculated brilliance—each sacrifice is a link in a logical chain leading to a forced checkmate. The game teaches us about the power of piece coordination: White's pieces work together like a well-rehearsed orchestra, while Black's pieces remain passive spectators to their own king's demise.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Piece coordination is worth more than material',
      'An attack on the king justifies significant sacrifices',
      'Passive pieces are effectively non-existent in the material count',
      'Calculate forcing sequences to their logical conclusion',
      'Development advantage must be converted before it evaporates',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Played just a year after the Immortal Game, this demonstrates that Anderssen\'s genius was no accident. The game was named "Evergreen" by Wilhelm Steinitz, who would later become the first World Champion, in recognition of its timeless beauty.',

    dayNumber: 3,
    white: 'Paul Morphy',
    black: 'Duke of Brunswick & Count Isouard',
    year: 1858,
    event: 'Paris Opera House',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: "Philidor's Defense",
    eco: 'C41',
    title: 'The Opera Game',
    themes: ['Development', 'Open files', 'Piece activity', 'Attack'],
    era: 'romantic',
    category: 'tactical',
    difficulty: 2,
    
    whyInstructive: `The Opera Game is the greatest teaching game in chess history. Every instructor uses it to demonstrate fundamental principles: develop your pieces, control the center, castle early, and create open files for your rooks. Morphy, just 21 years old, crushes two opponents playing in consultation while watching an opera. The game is a masterclass in punishing slow development—Black's queenside pieces never move, and they pay the ultimate price.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Develop all your pieces before starting an attack',
      'An undeveloped army cannot defend effectively',
      'Open files are highways for rooks to penetrate',
      'Knights before bishops (usually), center pawns first',
      'Time is the most precious resource in the opening',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Morphy was attending an opera in Paris when the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard challenged him to a game. Playing from a private box with the opera ongoing, Morphy delivered a crushing victory that would be studied for centuries. Morphy is considered by many to be the first unofficial World Champion.',

    whyInstructive: `This game features what many consider the most beautiful move in chess history: 22...Rxc3!! A quiet rook sacrifice that paralyzes White's entire army. Unlike flashy sacrifices for immediate checkmate, Rubinstein's sacrifice is about domination and zugzwang. Every White piece is overloaded or misplaced.`,

      'Beauty in chess often comes from restraint',

    dayNumber: 7,
    white: 'Wilhelm Steinitz',
    black: 'Curt von Bardeleben',
    year: 1895,
    event: 'Hastings',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Italian Game',
    eco: 'C54',
    title: 'The King Walk',
    themes: ['King march', 'Attack', 'Calculation', 'Zugzwang'],
    era: 'classical',
    category: 'attack',
    difficulty: 4,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game features one of the most spectacular conclusions in chess history. After a brilliant attack, Steinitz announced a forced checkmate in 10 moves, so complex that his opponent simply left the tournament hall rather than face the humiliation. The final combination involves the white king walking across the board!`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Calculate forcing sequences completely before executing',
      'An attack can succeed even when the king must participate',
      'When ahead in development, open the position',
      'The threat can be stronger than the execution',
      'Psychological warfare is part of chess',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Wilhelm Steinitz was the first official World Chess Champion (1886-1894). This game was played at the famous Hastings 1895 tournament, one of the strongest ever held at that time. When Steinitz began his final combination, Bardeleben saw the forced mate and simply left the playing hall, never returning.',

    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Dutch Defense',

    title: 'The King Hunt',
    themes: ['Sacrifice', 'King hunt', 'Attack', 'Forced mate'],
    era: 'classical',
    category: 'tactical',
    difficulty: 3,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game features one of the most famous king hunts ever. Lasker sacrifices his queen to drag Black's king from g8 all the way to g1 in one continuous sequence. The king crosses the entire board, taking captures along the way, only to be mated in the heart of White's position. It's a masterclass in forcing moves.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'When sacrificing, ensure every move is forcing',
      'A king in the open can be hunted relentlessly',
      'Calculate all checks before playing a combination',
      'Material is meaningless if the king cannot survive',
      'Piece coordination creates unstoppable attacks',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Emanuel Lasker was World Champion for 27 years (1894-1921), the longest reign in history. This game against Sir George Thomas showcases his combinative genius. The final king hunt is so spectacular it appears in virtually every tactics textbook.',

    whyInstructive: `This game marked the symbolic passing of chess supremacy from Capablanca to the Soviet school. Botvinnik's deep preparation and understanding of pawn structures allowed him to outplay the legendary Cuban. The exchange sacrifice on move 30 is one of the most famous in history—Botvinnik gives up a rook for a bishop to create an unstoppable passed pawn and attack.`,

  {
    id: 'tal-larsen',
    dayNumber: 12,
    white: 'Mikhail Tal',
    black: 'Bent Larsen',
    year: 1965,
    event: 'Candidates Quarterfinal',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Sicilian Defense',
    eco: 'B97',
    title: 'The Magician\'s Attack',
    themes: ['Sacrifice', 'Attack', 'King hunt', 'Calculation'],
    era: 'soviet',
    category: 'attack',
    difficulty: 5,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game showcases Tal at his absolute peak. Against one of the strongest players in the world, Tal sacrifices a piece on move 17, then offers his queen, and chases Larsen's king across the board. The depth of calculation is staggering—Tal saw 20+ moves ahead. This is attacking chess at its finest.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Calculate forcing variations completely before sacrificing',
      'A king in the open can be hunted relentlessly',
      'Piece activity and attack can justify any material deficit',
      'Trust your calculation when you see a clear path',
      'The initiative is worth more than material',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'This was the Candidates Quarterfinal match. Tal had lost his World Championship title to Botvinnik in 1961, and this was his comeback attempt. Larsen was the strongest Western player and a serious contender. Tal won this match 5.5-4.5.',

    whyInstructive: `This game is considered one of Fischer's finest positional masterpieces. After a solid opening, Fischer gradually outplays Spassky through superior pawn structure and piece placement. The endgame technique is flawless—Fischer converts a small advantage into a win through patient maneuvering. This game shows that chess at the highest level is often about accumulating small advantages.`,

    historicalContext: 'This was Game 6 of the 1972 World Championship match in Reykjavik. Fischer had lost the first game by forfeit, lost Game 2, and drawn Games 3-5. This win evened the score and gave Fischer confidence. He would go on to win the match 12.5-8.5.',

      'Deep opening preparation can yield decisive advantages',
      'A piece sacrifice can be sound if the attack is unstoppable',
      'When behind in a match, bold play is necessary',
      'Calculate forcing variations completely before sacrificing',
      'The initiative can be worth more than material',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'This was Game 16 of the 1985 World Championship match. Karpov led 5-3 (wins). Kasparov needed to win games to catch up. This victory gave him momentum, and he would go on to win the match 13-11 and become the youngest World Champion ever at age 22.',

  // ==========================================
  {
    id: 'kasparov-beliavsky',
    dayNumber: 76,
    white: 'Garry Kasparov',
    black: 'Alexander Beliavsky',
    year: 1983,
    event: 'Candidates',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Sicilian Defense',
    eco: 'B85',
    title: 'Future Champion',
    themes: ['Attack', 'King hunt'],
    era: 'modern',
    category: 'attack',
    difficulty: 4,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game from the 1983 Candidates tournament showcases the young Kasparov's attacking prowess. At just 20 years old, Kasparov demonstrates how to build an attack from a seemingly equal position, showing the importance of piece coordination and king safety. The game features a brilliant king hunt where Kasparov sacrifices material to expose the enemy king, teaching us that in modern chess, dynamic factors often outweigh material considerations.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Piece activity and coordination can justify material sacrifices',
      'An exposed king is a target—attack it relentlessly',
      'Modern chess rewards dynamic play over static material',
      'Preparation and opening knowledge create attacking opportunities',
      'The initiative must be maintained once seized',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'This game was played during Kasparov\'s first Candidates cycle, where he would eventually qualify to challenge Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. Beliavsky was a strong Soviet grandmaster, making this victory a significant statement from the young Kasparov.',

    year: 1914,
    event: 'St Petersburg',
    result: '1-0',

    title: 'Hypermodern Dawn',
    themes: ['Strategy', 'Control'],
    era: 'classical',
    category: 'strategy',
    difficulty: 4,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game represents the clash between classical and hypermodern chess. Tarrasch was the leading exponent of classical principles, while Nimzowitsch was developing his revolutionary hypermodern ideas. The game shows how control of the center can be achieved through indirect means rather than direct occupation.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'The center can be controlled indirectly',
      'Piece development is more important than pawn structure',
      'Hypermodern ideas challenge classical dogma',
      'Strategy requires understanding both approaches',
      'Control beats occupation in many positions',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'This game from St Petersburg 1914 was a clash of chess philosophies. Tarrasch represented classical chess with his famous "Tarrasch Rules," while Nimzowitsch was developing the hypermodern school that would revolutionize chess thinking.',

    era: 'classical',
    category: 'attack',
    difficulty: 4,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game from Carlsbad 1929 showcases Vidmar's attacking prowess. The game demonstrates how to build an attack through piece coordination and when to sacrifice material for the initiative. Vidmar's play shows the power of coordinated pieces in attack.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Coordinated pieces are stronger than material',
      'Sacrifices must be calculated precisely',
      'The initiative can be worth more than a pawn',
      'Attack requires all pieces working together',
      'Timing is crucial in sacrificial attacks',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'Milan Vidmar was one of the strongest players from Yugoslavia. This game from Carlsbad 1929, one of the strongest tournaments of the era, shows his attacking style. Max Euwe would later become World Champion in 1935.',

    dayNumber: 82,
    white: 'Vladimir Kramnik',
    black: 'Garry Kasparov',
    year: 2000,
    event: 'World Championship',
    result: '1-0',
    opening: 'Ruy Lopez',
    eco: 'C67',
    title: 'Berlin Wall',
    themes: ['Opening', 'Strategy'],
    era: 'modern',
    category: 'strategy',
    difficulty: 5,
    
    whyInstructive: `This game from the 2000 World Championship match showcases Kramnik's revolutionary opening preparation. The Berlin Defense, which had been considered drawish, became Kramnik's weapon of choice to neutralize Kasparov's attacking prowess. This game demonstrates how deep opening preparation and strategic understanding can overcome even the strongest opponents. The "Berlin Wall" became famous for its solidity and effectiveness.`,
    
    keyLessons: [
      'Opening preparation can neutralize even the strongest attacks',
      'Strategic understanding is as important as tactical ability',
      'Sometimes the "boring" moves are the most effective',
      'Endgame technique wins games at the highest level',
      'Preparation and psychology go hand in hand',
    ],
    
    historicalContext: 'This was game 2 of the 2000 World Championship match in London. Kramnik, the challenger, used the Berlin Defense to neutralize Kasparov\'s attacking style. Kramnik won the match 8.5-6.5, becoming the first player to defeat Kasparov in a World Championship match since 1985.',
